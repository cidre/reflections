When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I needed to work from different places, for example at home and at the office, I would prefer using remote repository. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pull requests will allow me to divide my work into logically separated pieces.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of repo from anothre account on GitHub with all files, commits history and link to the original repository. Clone is a copy on local computer of my local or remote repository. Branches are labels for different commits at one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It will help to resolve merging conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    I would want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master when I  work as     contributor with repo which has another owner and when I will need to get opinion from my teammate     before merging new features with master branch.
